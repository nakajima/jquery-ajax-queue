= jQuery AJAX Queue =

Provides a simple interface for creating AJAX requests that wait
their turn in line. Only one request in the queue can ever be active
at once. Once the active request finishes, the next request can start.

Usage:

  $.ajaxQueue.post('/some-place');
  $.ajaxQueue.get('/another');
  $.ajaxQueue.put('/another');
  $.ajaxQueue.del('/another');
